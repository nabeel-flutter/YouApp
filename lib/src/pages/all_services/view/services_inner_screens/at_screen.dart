                      '''One of the first things you’ll do as a part of your treatment at NEW BEGINNINGS is participate in a psychiatric evaluation. Mental illness and addiction often go hand in hand. We’ll talk to you about any mental illnesses you’re dealing with, and will either continue any current medications, make adjustments to what you’re taking, or prescribe something new, as part of addiction treatment and addiction treatment outpatient. If you're looking for rehab centers near me, we can help guide you to the most suitable options.
We use cutting-edge pharmacogenetic testing to predict how your body will respond to certain meds based on your DNA. The idea is to eliminate frustrating guesswork and get the right meds right away, so you can feel better, faster.
Our psychiatric team can also prescribe medications to help ease or eliminate withdrawal symptoms during Medical Detox. Many of our treatment centers also offer medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to reduce cravings and/or block the effects of drugs and alcohol. MAT, in combination with psychotherapy, is proven to be very effective in helping people get sober and stay that way long-term. Therapy Modalities
Psychotherapy is a broad term. What does it mean for you in addiction treatment and addiction treatment outpatient? Lasting recovery starts with the latest proven, research-based tactics* in addiction and mental health treatment, including:

• Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
• Motivational interviewing (MI)
• Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
• Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)
• Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
• Motivational enhancement therapy (MET)

At a NEW BEGINNINGS center, you or your loved one will have access to wellness education, services, and activities to enrich your recovery journey, including addiction treatment and addiction treatment outpatient. If you're seeking a drug rehabilitation center near me, we can assist you in finding suitable options. For example, you might choose to learn more about healthy eating or decide to quit smoking; maybe you’ll get moving with yoga, basketball, Zumba, or physical conditioning. If you have special dietary needs or simply want to eat healthier, most facilities offer consultations with registered dietitians. And if you’re dealing with medical issues or chronic disease, we can help you learn to manage your health, too.

Wellness means improving your quality of life from the inside out. Most NEW BEGINNINGS centers host faith-based services or religious/spirituality groups, and we’ll do everything we can to be sensitive to your religious needs. And if your addiction has left its mark on your career, many of our treatment centers offer services like resume building, job preparedness workshops, and help with job hunting as you get back on your feet.''',
